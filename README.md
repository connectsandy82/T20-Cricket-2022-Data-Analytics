# 🏏 End-to-End Cricket Data Analytics: Assembling the Ultimate T20 Team! 🎉

Excited to share my latest project where I embarked on a data-driven journey to select the top 11 T20 cricket players! 🌟 This project combined web scraping, Python, and Power BI to uncover deep insights and craft a dynamic dashboard. Here’s how I did it:

## Project Title: “End-to-End Cricket Data Analytics Using Python, Pandas, and Power BI”

## Problem Statement
Imagine Earth facing an imminent threat from invading aliens who challenge us to a high-stakes T20 cricket match. The fate of humanity rests on assembling the “BEST 11” cricket team to take on the Alien 11.

## Step-by-Step Journey

### 1️⃣ Data Gathering with Web Scraping
- **Access Data**: Accessed cricket data from sources like the ICC website and ESPN Cricinfo.
- **Web Scraping**: Utilized web scraping techniques in Python to extract data in JSON format.
- **Save Data**: Saved the JSON data for further processing.

### 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing and Cleaning in Python
- **Import Libraries**: Imported essential libraries like Pandas for data manipulation.
- **Data Cleaning**: Performed preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting data.
- **Data Consistency**: Ensured data consistency and accuracy.

### 3️⃣ Transforming JSON to CSV
- **Conversion**: Converted the cleaned JSON data into CSV using Pandas.
- **Data Handling**: Facilitated easy data handling and analysis.
- **Save Data**: Saved the CSV file for the next step.

    - ## Jupyter Notebook Analysis:

      Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and transformation were performed using Python in Jupyter Notebook. The notebook's objectives are to analyze the data 
      and present data-driven insights.

      ### Steps in the Jupyter Notebook:

       1. **Data Import and Data Exploration:**
          - Importing data from various sources.
          - Initial exploration to understand data structure and content.

       2. **Data Cleaning:**
          - Handling missing values.
          - Correcting data types.
          - Removing duplicates and irrelevant data.

       3. **Data Transformation:**
          - Creating new features.
          - Normalizing and scaling data.
          - Preparing data for analysis and visualization.

### 4️⃣ Analyzing Data with Power BI
- **Import CSV**: Imported the CSV file into Power BI for in-depth analysis.
- **Data Exploration**: Explored data with Power BI’s visualization tools to uncover trends and insights.
- **Dashboard Creation**: Created dynamic dashboards to showcase the findings.

### 5️⃣ Building Parameters Using DAX Functions
- **DAX Functions**: Defined specific metrics and parameters using DAX in Power BI to select the “BEST 11” players.

### 6️⃣ Creating a Compelling Dashboard
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Crafted an interactive and visually stunning dashboard in Power BI.
- **Highlighting Top Players**: Highlighted the top 11 players and their stellar performances.
- **Detailed Insights**: Showcased detailed insights on player performance and team dynamics.
